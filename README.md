Order of events
- Upping all servers individually
 - All upped servers start a listener for client/server connections
- Client sends "start" to one server
- Server that receives "start" broadcasts election start to other servers
 - For now, it can just broadcast "I am your leader"
- When a server receives a "leader is #" message
 - Leader server runs "lead\_connections" and other servers run "leader\_listener"
